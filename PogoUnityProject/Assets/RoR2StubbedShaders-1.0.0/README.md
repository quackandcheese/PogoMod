# RoR2StubbedShaders

Stubbed Shaders are custom shaders used during the development of a mod for saving the property data of materials.

This is used to later on, at runtime, swap the stubbed shaders for the actual game's shaders. Which will allow for the visuals to properly work while keeping all the properties intact.

## Features

* Includes every relevant stubbed shader for ror2
*  Shader names are formatted as addressables strings to easily link stubbed and real shaders at runtime
* Shader properties have been updated for ease-of-use in the editorsed stubbed shaders for developing mods for Risk of Rain 2
